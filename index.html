            <h1>Personal Profile</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Hello! My name is Hassan Hayat, and I am a 16-year-old MERN stack developer from Karachi. I have recently completed my metric education and am passionate about web development. The MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, is my area of expertise.</p>
<br><br>
                
                  <p class="h">  I am skilled in designing and managing databases with MongoDB, developing fast and scalable server-side applications with Express.js, and building interactive user interfaces with React. Node.js allows me to handle server-side operations seamlessly, making the development process smooth and efficient.
                    <br><br>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                As a MERN stack developer, I can handle both front-end and back-end development, ensuring the websites I create are visually appealing and functionally robust. Whether you need a personal blog, an e-commerce platform, or a complex web application, I can help you create a website that meets your needs and exceeds your expectations. Thank you for considering me for your web development projects, and I look forward to the opportunity to work with you.</p>
